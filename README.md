# ASCTools Overview
---
## ASCTools provides quick and simple tools for performing repetitive actions on .ASC raster files.

Source code can be found in /src/  
Prebuilt binaries can be found in /bin/ for **MacOS** and **Linux**.

Additionally, tools are being developed for working with [LSS](https://www.dtmsoftware.com/) proprietary files.  
These files store point/line information and the tools aim to ease use of these files outside of the program.
